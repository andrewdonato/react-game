React is a Javascript library.
It acts as a view.
React operates using a hierarchy of components to pass state.
Anytime the data changes, react recreates the whole application.
This sounds slow but is not because React operates using a virtual DOM.

React creates a virtual DOM.
The application speaks with the virtual DOM.
React then applies changes in the real DOM to the virtual DOM.
